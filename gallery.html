    There is 18 flowers in the bigger bouquet (yellow). I did a mini bouquet of just 5 purple flowers I combined both bouquets, however if you prefer seperate thats always an option as well. If you are requesting bouquet please note that color of yarn both for 'petals' and leaves and material you request for the stem (I used pipe cleaners for this batch) is included in the price. Something like this bouquet would range from $15-$22, it increases or decreases based on the amount of flowers you desire.</p>

    Here is a custom family that can of course me altered to fit your family best! Above is a Dua or a small prayer to God for us to say for our parents. However if there are certain phrases, quotes, duas, anything you'd like to say that can easily be put for you as long as their is no inappropriate aspects/vulgar terms. This would be apart of a foam book so you get the chance to customize four pages, the price is not listed only because this is a custom business so all prices are discussed and given at the end of consultation whether that be throuhgh text or email. However to give you a round-about $25-30. </p>

    Displayed is an ideal cover or back image to stir up some ideas of how you may want to gift someone or even treat yourself! On the lower half of the page you'll see some 3D cutouts that are shaped like a cloud and crescent moon, however can also be customized to your liking.

    Here is another idea of a potential cover or back page design that may inspire you-of course during consultation or through your creative ideas that you inform me about we can come up with some brilliant ways to bring your vision to life. This is a Single Layer Foam Book, customized for a 5 yr old boy, who loves nature and all that comes with it, his mother gave me free range with this gift!

    Portrayed here is a Double layered Foam Book that does have more support and free range if thats something you would prefer and even the potential of opening it up to SIX pages rather than the typical four for a Single Layered Foam Book. This Family did request privacy within the photos they provided, and gave me consent to demonstrate other designs such as line art/flowers, threaded hearts and once again 3D foam images. </p>
