        My name is SumayaðŸ©¶, I am a revert to Islam and am so excited to share with you my ideas. (SISTERS who would love to become friends, I would loveeee that). 
    </p> 
    I specialize in creating personalized foam board book displays with thread that capture whatever image you desire, and inside of this book is even more customized writing (names/dates/duas/designs) and your pictures are forwarded to me. (Alternative options for those who do not want photos will be provided upon request/based on design). I use a mini sticker printer (with color) to print out your lovely pictures. I love to make yarn flowers and will make as many as you wish as long as the bouquet contains a minimum of 5 flowers. I also make Kiss Boxes (images will be up soon and maybe even partnering in the future with a storefont so keep a look out! 
    </p> 
    Inshallah (God-willing), We can work together to incorporate your ideas and values so that each piece is a heartfelt expression that blends creativity with personal significance. I do intend on spreading on more platforms so stay up-to-date please - any and all support is greatly appreciated.</p>
